This\nintroduces additional checks to guard against the edge case being hit to\navoid the panic.\n\nThe specific checks being added are: if an item being decoded into a\nstruct is a literal type, the item to be decoded must be non-nil in\norder to use it. This isn't super clear and to be honest I also don't\nfully understand it but this fixes the problem without introducing any\nmore test failures and without significant code complexity.\n"}
