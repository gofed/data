This\nmay have never been the correct behavior but always worked okay because\nwe previously didn't support lists as first class types.\n\nWith the support of lists, we need to actually return the empty list as\nthe type. If we return nothing, then projects like Terraform will think\nthat the value was never set, which is false.\n"}
